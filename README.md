# AGoT Replays

This site tries to provide a collection of links to Videos of A Game of Thrones tournament play.

## How to add links

Right now the only way to add links, is to clone this git repository, create a jnew `\*.json` file in `_data/tourneys` and create a push request.

I think anyone who understood that description will be able to figure out how that file has to be strucuted, so I will save myself further explanations for now.

A form to submit new tournaments for less tech savy users is in the works.
